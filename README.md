# Project Title: Implementing a House Price Prediction Model - A CRISP-DM Framework
**Introduction**
This project focuses on the development of house price prediction models using the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework. Two machine learning techniques, Random Forest and Multiple Linear Regression, are implemented to predict house prices. The model helps stakeholders in the real estate and finance sectors make informed decisions about buying, selling, and investing in properties by accurately forecasting property values based on various features such as location, size, and condition.

**CRISP-DM Framework Overview**
CRISP-DM is a widely used framework for data mining projects. It consists of six phases, ensuring a systematic and structured approach to data analysis and model building:

**Business Understanding: Identify business objectives and define data mining goals.**
Data Understanding: Gather, explore, and assess data for quality issues.
Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess data for modeling.
Modeling: Develop machine learning models to predict house prices.
Evaluation: Assess the models' performance and select the best one.
Deployment: Implement the model for real-world application.
Project Phases

**1. Business Understanding**
The objective is to build a model that predicts house prices based on features like neighborhood, number of rooms, and utilities. The primary research questions are:

How do house prices vary across different neighborhoods?
What are the relationships between various house features and their prices?

**2. Data Understanding**
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes 81 features and 2919 rows. It contains detailed information about American housing, including physical attributes, location, and sale conditions.

**3. Data Preparation**
Data cleaning and transformation steps included:

Removing irrelevant features: Out of 81 columns, only 23 were retained for the predictive model.
Handling missing values: 162 missing values were detected and treated.
Converting categorical variables: Categorical data was converted into factors for better processing by machine learning algorithms.
Splitting the data: The dataset was split into training (1300 rows) and testing sets for model evaluation.

**4. Modeling**
Two models were developed to predict house prices:

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR): A linear model that establishes relationships between house features and prices.
Performance: MLR explained 81.02% of the variance in house prices and had a strong Adjusted R-squared value of 79.79%.
Random Forest (RF): An ensemble model that uses multiple decision trees for regression tasks.
Performance: RF captured 82.95% of the variance, but higher error rates and signs of overfitting were noted.

**5. Evaluation**
The following metrics were used to evaluate the models:

R-squared (RÂ²): Proportion of variance explained by the model.
MSE (Mean Squared Error): Average squared difference between real and predicted values.
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): The square root of MSE, returning the error in the same units as the target.
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Average of the absolute errors between predicted and actual values.

*Model Comparison:*

MLR performed more consistently, with lower errors, and proved to be more reliable for predicting house prices.
RF captured complex relationships but had higher errors and overfitting issues.

**6. Deployment**
The Multiple Linear Regression model was selected for deployment due to its accuracy and simplicity. It provides a reliable and user-friendly tool for predicting house prices in real estate applications.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the implementation of a house price prediction model using the CRISP-DM framework. By comparing the performance of Random Forest and Multiple Linear Regression, we determined that MLR offers a more stable and interpretable solution for predicting house prices. The systematic approach outlined in CRISP-DM ensures effective data analysis and model building, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in the real estate industry.
